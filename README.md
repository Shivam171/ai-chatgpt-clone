# üß† AI-ChatGPT-Clone

This project is a **simple GPT Chat** similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. Users can ask questions, and the AI provides responses using the **Gemini API**. Additionally, users can upload images, and the AI will provide answers related to the image.

The design of this project is inspired by the beautiful design from [SayHalo - Next Level Chat AI](https://dribbble.com/shots/24631824-SayHalo-Next-Level-Chat-AI) created by Asal Design for Kretya Studio on Dribbble. üé®

This is a **full-stack project** built with modern web technologies and styled using **Tailwind CSS**. It supports **user authentication** via Clerk and stores user chat history in MongoDB. The interface is responsive and supports markdown rendering, text-to-speech (TTS), and clipboard copy functionality for AI responses.

If you like this project, give it a ‚≠ê.
